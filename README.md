# tic-tac-toe (No Lists/Arrays)

## üéØ Project Overview
This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built in Python **without using lists or arrays**. The goal was to implement the game logic creatively while avoiding common data structures.  
Though it may not be the most efficient coding for a tic-tac-toe game, it challenged me to think simply to resolve a problem.

## üîß How It Works
- Players **X** and **O** take turns entering their moves.
- The board is stored and updated without using lists.
- The game checks for a **win condition** after each move.
- The game announces a winner or declares a draw if the board is full.
